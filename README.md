# Licenses and Standards
A free license or open license is a license agreement which contains conditions permitted to the user from the holder on a specific list of uses for his work, which gives him four major freedoms.
Without a special license, these uses are normally prohibited by the laws of copyright. 

For content we can use licenses like Creative Commons

# How we can work together and share content?
We can use a lot of platforms to work together like Github, Google Docs, and etc.

When we are using those platforms, we need to add an open license to guarantee that our content will be accessible to reuse and to remix!
